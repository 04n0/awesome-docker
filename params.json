Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.\r\n\r\n_Source:_ [What is Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)\r\n\r\n# Where to start ?\r\n\r\n* [10-minute Interactive Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/mac/)\r\n* [Docker Training](http://training.docker.com/)\r\n* Read this complete article: [Basics â€“ Docker, Containers, Hypervisors, CoreOS](http://etherealmind.com/basics-docker-containers-hypervisors-coreos/)\r\n* Watch the video: [Docker for Developers][docker4dev] (54:26) by [@jpetazzo][jpetazzo]\r\n* [Docker Jumpstart](https://github.com/odewahn/docker-jumpstart/): a quick introduction\r\n* [Docker Curriculum](http://prakhar.me/docker-curriculum/): A comprehensive tutorial for getting started with Docker.
